Make a simple grid based image display layout

Let us say you have n images at your disposal. 
The task is to display them in a grid layout within a web page


1. Maximum images in a row is 6, all images should be displayed in a 200 x 200 size and 
will be equally spaced
2. The grid should initialize with a placeholder images and 
should be replaced with the actual image when it loads
3. The number of images in all rows except the last should be the same
4. The layout should be responsive, i.e. the number of images in a row will change 
based on the screen size
5. On image hover, flip the image and show some description(dummy text) and 
a delete icon, clicking on which should remove the image from the layout, 
all other images should adjust themselves
6. Add a shuffle button on the top, on clicking on which, 
images should be randomly assigned new positions. 


NOTE: Avoid use of any framework. Use only native HTML, CSS, JS.
Please make assumptions as necessary. You will be scored on the coding style and quality and code architecture primarily. Extra points will be awarded for animation when the images are reshuffled.
